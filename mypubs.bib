  abstract = {Due to the increasing amount of Linked Data openly published on the Web, user-facing Linked Data Applications (LDAs) are gaining momentum. One of the major entrance barriers for Web developers to contribute to this wave of LDAs is the required knowledge of Semantic Web technologies such as the RDF data model and SPARQL query language. This paper presents an adaptive component-based approach together with its open source implementation for creating flexible and reusable Semantic Web interfaces driven by Linked Data. Linked Data-driven (LD-R) Web components abstract the complexity of the underlying Semantic Web technologies in order to allow reuse of existing Web components in LDAs, enabling Web developers who are not experts in Semantic Web to develop interfaces that view, edit and browse Linked Data. In addition to the modularity provided by the LD-R components, the proposed RDF-based configuration method allows application assemblers to reshape their user interface for different use cases, by either reusing existing shared configurations or by creating their proprietary configurations.},

	a fact view and the respective HTML/RDFa source code view. The views
	are synchronized such that changes made in one of the views automatically
	update the others. They provide different means of semantic content
	authoring for the different personas involved in the content creation
	life-cycle. For bootstrapping the semantic annotation process we
	integrate five different text annotation services. We evaluate their
	accuracy and empirically show that a combination of them yields superior
